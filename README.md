Understanding the Data set

Sonar (sound navigation and ranging) is a technique based on the principle of reflection of ultrasonic sound waves. These waves propagate through water and reflect on hitting the ocean bed or any object obstructing its path.Sonar has been widely used in submarine navigation, communication with or detection of objects on or under the water surface (like other vessels), hazard identification, etc. This dataset was used in Gorman, R. P., and Sejnowski, T. J. (1988). "Analysis of Hidden Units in a Layered Network Trained to Classify Sonar Targets" in Neural Networks, Vol. 1, pp. 75-89. The CSV files contain data regarding sonar signals bounced off a metal cylinder (mines - M) and a roughly cylindrical rock (rock - R) at various angles and under various conditions. There are 60 attributes and one categorical column in the dataset.
